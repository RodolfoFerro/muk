1. Please visit the [download section](https://www.python.org/downloads/) of the [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/) to download the 3.x executable version of the Python installer.
2. Please follow the instructions installing Python. *
3. To check if the installation is in order to begin, open a console in your computer and type `'python' + Enter`; this should open the Python prompt `>>>`. If any error is shown, everything is fine with your installation.
