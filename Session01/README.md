# Session 1: Basics 1

Welcome to the very first session of our course, based on Udacity's MOOC [Programming Foundations with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036). Here you'll find a description of what we worked the first session.

## Conditionals
The if statement contains a logical expression using which data is compared and a decision is made based on the result of the comparison.

An else statement can be combined with an if statement. An else statement contains the block of code that executes if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value.

The elif statement allows you to check multiple expressions for TRUE and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE.

Similar to the else, the elif statement is optional. However, unlike else, for which there can be at most one statement, there can be an arbitrary number of elif statements following an if.

#### Syntax:
The syntax of conditionals in Python programming language is:
```python
if expression1:
   statement(s)
elif expression2:
   statement(s)
elif expression3:
   statement(s)
else:
   statement(s)
```
Check the [if_example.py](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/muk/blob/master/Session01/if_example.py) code.


## While Loop
A **while** loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

#### Syntax:
The syntax of a while loop in Python programming language is:
```python
while expression:
   statement(s)
```
Check the [while_example.py](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/muk/blob/master/Session01/while_example.py) code.
